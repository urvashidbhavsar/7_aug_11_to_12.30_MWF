        <abbr title="high-level, often just-in-time compiled language">JavaScript</abbr>
          is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the <b>ECMAScript standard</b>.<sup>[11]</sup> It has
        dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is <ins>multi-paradigm, supporting
        event-driven, functional, and imperative</ins> programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
        working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the <em><b>Document Object Model (DOM)</b></em>.

        During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior
        after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this
        limitation, so in <mark>1995</mark>, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve
        this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to
        embed the Scheme language.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">[6]</a></sup>
